How it works
============

This website allows you to choose a CSV file. Without uploading that file to
any servers, the browser parses the CSV and identifies column names and data
types. It then prompts you to annotate each column with a specific meaning or
description. Behind the scenes, this creates a machine-readable annotation for
your CSV. Together this annotation and the CSV file forms a portable _data
package_.

Individual states will be able to deploy this open source tool, enabling
eligible training providers to easily annotate and upload data packages
with participant outcomes to the states.
